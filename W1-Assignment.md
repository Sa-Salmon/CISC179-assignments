## 2. Discuss the real-world example where Python performance is superior to compiled languages such as C++. To answer this question, you need to do some research.
Python can perform better than C++ in the real of data science and machine learning as it ha rapid development cycles, extensive libraries, the ability to quickly prototype and iterate on complex algorithms. Making it more efficient for data analysis and model training, even if individual operations might be slightly slower compared to C++ on a micro-level.
## 3.Take a screenshot that shows that Python3 is installed successfully on your PC.

## 4.Take a screenshot that shows that the Github repository is all set up for this course.
